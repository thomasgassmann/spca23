## a

Checks for a non-null pointer and if so dereferences it and checks whether it is zero or not (expression is true if not zero).

## b

Trick because the stack is located at higher addresses than the heap.

## c

Calculates $b^n$.

## d

Copies the string at `t` to `s` (i.e. copies all the bytes until we get a null character).

## e

- POINT
- ER
- ST
- EW

## f

Most likely: `0\n0`. The first digit may be non-zero.

## g

`s1.c[0] = a     *s1.s = d       s2.cp = ghi     s2.ss1.s = mno  ++s2.cp = hi    ++s2.ss1.s = no`
