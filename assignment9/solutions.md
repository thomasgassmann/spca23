# Assignment 9

## Question 1

- Measured CPE for A3: the computation graph of A3 and A4 are the same, therefore we have 1.67
- Measured CPE for A5: we rely on r from the previous iteration, the other computation can be done in parallel, final multiplication with both of these results, therefore same situation as in A2

| Version | Measured CPE | Theoretical CPE |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| A1      | 5.00         |                 |
| A2      | 3.67         |                 |
| A3      | 1.67         |                 |
| A4      | 1.67         |                 |
| A5      | 3.67         |                 |
